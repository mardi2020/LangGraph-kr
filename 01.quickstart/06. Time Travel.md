## Part 6: Time Travel

일반적인 챗봇 흐름에서는 사용자가 봇과 여러 차례 상호작용하며 작업을 수행합니다. 앞서 우리는 메모리와 human-in-the-loop 기능을 추가해 그래프 상태를 checkpoint하고 이후 응답 흐름을 제어하는 방법을 배웠습니다.

하지만 사용자가 이전 응답에서 출발해 다른 결과를 탐색하도록 '분기'하고 싶다면 어떻게 해야 할까요? 혹은 사용자가 어시스턴트의 작업을 '되감기' 해서 실수를 수정하거나 다른 전략을 시도할 수 있도록 하고 싶다면요? (이는 애플리케이션에서 흔히 필요한 기능입니다.)

LangGraph의 내장된 'time travel' 기능을 사용하면 이러한 경험들을 모두 구현할 수 있습니다.

이번 섹션에서는 `graph.get_state_history` 메서드를 사용해 체크포인트를 가져오고, 그래프를 이전 시점으로 '되감기' 하여 실행을 다시 이어가는 방법을 배웁니다.

이를 위해 Part 3에서 사용했던 도구가 포함된 간단한 챗봇 예제를 다시 사용해보겠습니다.

```python
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]


graph_builder = StateGraph(State)


tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)


def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}


graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    tools_condition,
)
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

그래프가 여러 단계를 거치도록 하고, 그때마다 상태 기록에 체크포인트가 남도록 해보겠습니다:
``` python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
events = graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": (
                    "I'm learning LangGraph. "
                    "Could you do some research on it for me?"
                ),
            },
        ],
    },
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```
```

Thank you for your patience. I've found some recent information about LangGraph for you. Let me summarize the key points:

1. LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem, which is a leading platform in AI development.

2. Recent updates and features of LangGraph include:

   a. LangGraph Cloud: This seems to be a cloud-based version of LangGraph, though specific details weren't provided in the search results.

   b. LangGraph Platform: This is a newly introduced concept that combines several offerings:
      - LangGraph Server
      - LangGraph Studio
      - CLI (Command Line Interface)
      - SDK (Software Development Kit)

3. LangGraph Server: This component has received new features to enhance its value proposition, though the specific features weren't detailed in the search results.

4. LangGraph Studio: This appears to be a new tool in the LangGraph ecosystem, likely providing a graphical interface for working with LangGraph.

5. Documentation: The LangGraph documentation has been revamped, which should make it easier for learners like yourself to understand and use the tool.

6. Integration with LangSmith: While not directly part of LangGraph, LangSmith (another tool in the LangChain ecosystem) now features self-improving evaluators, which might be relevant if you're using LangGraph as part of a larger LangChain project.

As you're learning LangGraph, it would be beneficial to:

1. Check out the official LangChain documentation, especially the newly revamped LangGraph sections.
2. Explore the different components of the LangGraph Platform (Server, Studio, CLI, and SDK) to see which best fits your learning needs.
3. Keep an eye on LangGraph Cloud developments, as cloud-based solutions often provide an easier starting point for learners.
4. Consider how LangGraph fits into the broader LangChain ecosystem, especially its interaction with tools like LangSmith.

Is there any specific aspect of LangGraph you'd like to know more about? I'd be happy to do a more focused search on particular features or use cases.

Great idea! Building an autonomous agent with LangGraph is definitely an exciting project. Based on the latest information I've found, here are some insights and tips for building autonomous agents with LangGraph:

1. Multi-Tool Agents: LangGraph is particularly well-suited for creating autonomous agents that can use multiple tools. This allows your agent to have a diverse set of capabilities and choose the right tool for each task.

2. Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs): You can combine LangGraph with powerful LLMs like Gemini 2.0 to create more intelligent and capable agents. The LLM can serve as the "brain" of your agent, making decisions and generating responses.

3. Workflow Management: LangGraph excels at managing complex, multi-step AI workflows. This is crucial for autonomous agents that need to break down tasks into smaller steps and execute them in the right order.

4. Practical Tutorials Available: There are tutorials available that provide full code examples for building and running multi-tool agents. These can be incredibly helpful as you start your project.

5. Langchain Integration: LangGraph is often used in conjunction with Langchain. This combination provides a powerful framework for building AI agents, offering features like memory management, tool integration, and prompt management.

6. GitHub Resources: There are repositories available (like the one by anmolaman20) that provide comprehensive resources for building AI agents using Langchain and LangGraph. These can be valuable references as you develop your agent.

7. Real-time Adaptation: LangGraph allows you to create agents that can think, reason, and adapt in real-time, which is crucial for truly autonomous behavior.

8. Customization: You can equip your agent with specific tools tailored to your use case. For example, you might include tools for web searching, data analysis, or interacting with specific APIs.

To get started with your autonomous agent project:

1. Familiarize yourself with LangGraph's documentation and basic concepts.
2. Look into tutorials that specifically deal with building autonomous agents, like the one mentioned from Towards Data Science.
3. Decide on the specific capabilities you want your agent to have and identify the tools it will need.
4. Start with a simple agent and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the framework.
5. Experiment with different LLMs to find the one that works best for your use case.
6. Pay attention to how you structure the agent's decision-making process and workflow.
7. Don't forget to implement proper error handling and safety measures, especially if your agent will be interacting with external systems or making important decisions.

Building an autonomous agent is an iterative process, so be prepared to refine and improve your agent over time. Good luck with your project! If you need any more specific information as you progress, feel free to ask.
